                The holidays are coming. Let's make some chocolate and get a date :)) This 2-ingredient recipe is super easy and delicious!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>240g Condensed milk</li>
                    <li>100g Cocoa powder</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Instructions:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil 240g of condensed milk.</li>
                    <li>Sift in 100g of cocoa powder into the milk while it's still hot.</li>
                    <li>Stir until well incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Place into a container with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2–3 hours.</li>
                    <li>The truffle should have hardened. Place on top of cocoa powder and cut into even pieces, before coating with another layer of cocoa powder.</li>
                    <li>This kind of truffle won't melt, and it's soft, so it's perfect for gifts or as a snack. Enjoy!</li>

            <p>This recipe site has a clean color palette and some unique interactive features that make it stand out and adds utility for its users. For example, the servings feature on the recipe card is slide-adjustable, allowing for easy customization of the recipe portions. Additionally, the "story" portion of the recipe is relatively short, and the hierarchy of the recipe card is very clear.</p>

            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/274966/sheet-pan-parmesan-chicken-and-veggies/">Allrecipes</a>
            <p>I enjoy how this recipe site has pictures accomanying almost every step of the process, in addition to a gallery of images right at the beginning of the recipe. I also appreciate how the nutrition facts are styled in the standard nutrition label format, which makes it much easier to comprehend the information at a glance.</p>

            <p>This recipe site has a very thoughtful toggle feature called "Cook Mode", which, when on, prevents your screen from going dark. There are also quick links for readers to buy the ingredients and/or the equipment needed for the recipe, which I think are both very useful options to have for anyone looking to make the dish.</p>

            <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/">pixiv</a>
            <p>This site is an art sharing site/community for artists to share their own works and view others'. I think that the many methods of sorting (by ranking, latest posts, and categories) are very useful on a site intended to archive so much art. I also really like the tagging system, which allows artists to tag their works and create and maintain a self-sorting system.</p>

            <a href="https://www.prydwen.gg">Prydwen.gg</a>
            <p>As a large game database, this site takes on the challenge of organizing large amounts of data in a manner most suited to visitors of the site—players of the respective games. In order to do so, the site has prioritized specific aspects of each game (placing them on the side-bar menu) and, from there, has established many rather complex yet intuitive and easily navigated sub-page hierarchies.</p>
            <br>
            <a href="https://origami.me">Origami.me</a>
            <p>This instructional site has everything someone looking to learn origami would need. I really enjoy the range of difficulties the projects encompass. I also really like the side-by-side format the instructions have, with one "realistic" depiction of the step and another illustrated representation of it, which seem to be taken from a pdf of the process that can be printed out for personal use.</p>
