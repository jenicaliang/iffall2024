    <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>My name is Jenica. I am a sophomore majoring in Communication Design, and minoring in Psychology and HCI.</li>
        <li>Aside from this class being required for ComDes majors, I've always wanted to learn more about front-end web development.</li>
        <li>I have used simplified versions of HTML and CSS while creating sites for fun on wiki hosting services.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to create a visually appealing, useful, and interactive website.</li>
        <li>One way I expect designing for the screen to be different than designing for paper is the necessary consideration for different screen sizes as well as any interactive elements.</li>
        <li>A website that I think exemplifies effective design: https://neal.fun. 
            <ul>
               <li>I think this site is effective design because its simplicity matches the similarily straightforward purpose of the site: to provide a way to access a variety of unique short games.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A website that I think exemplifies effective communication: https://kota.co.uk. 
            <ul>
                <li>I think the way this site is designed, with preset scroll points and plenty of animation, strongly emphasizes the creativity and strong visual direction of this branding agency.</li>
             </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A website that I think works well: https://www.pinterest.com
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I think this website works well for the purpose of finding visual references and inspiration for all sorts of topics on the web.
